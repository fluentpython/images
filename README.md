# Fluent Python images

These images were used in the Fluent Python book manuscript. Unless otherwise noted, they were all created by Luciano Ramalho. 

Most of them were used in the 1st edition of the book, but some were replaced by other images created by O'Reilly staff. The images created by O'Reilly are not in this repository.
